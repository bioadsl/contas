# Upgrade guide for Scheduler v5.3.6

## The `getEvents()` function of `ResourceModel` is deprecated

It will be removed in version 6.0.0. Use the `events` property instead.

**Old code**

```javascript
const events = resource.getEvents();
```

**New code**

```javascript
const { events } = resource;
```
