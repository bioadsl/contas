# What's new in Calendar v5.3.0

## AjaxHelper.fetch now supports passing parameters in request body

Since this release [AjaxHelper.fetch](#Core/helper/AjaxHelper#function-fetch-static) method can pass provided `queryParams`
in the request body instead of query string. This happens for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and
`multipart/form-data` content types when `addQueryParamsToBody` option is set to `true`:

```javascript
AjaxHelper.fetch('url', {
    headers : {
        'Content-Type' : 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
    },
    addQueryParamsToBody : true
});
```

Please check `addQueryParamsToBody` in [FetchOptions](#Core/helper/AjaxHelper#typedef-FetchOptions)

**Please note** that this behavior is disabled by default so if you need to enable it globally please use
[AjaxHelper.DEFAULT_FETCH_OPTIONS](#Core/helper/AjaxHelper#property-DEFAULT_FETCH_OPTIONS-static):

```javascript
// enable addQueryParamsToBody by default
AjaxHelper.DEFAULT_FETCH_OPTIONS = {
    addQueryParamsToBody : true
}
```

## Time Zone Support

Support for time zone conversion has been added to all Bryntum scheduling products. Simply set a IANA time zone
identifier as value for the [timeZone](#Scheduler/model/ProjectModel#config-timeZone) config and that's it.

But since time zones is not natively supported in JavaScript we strongly recommend to read our
[Time zone guide](#Scheduler/guides/customization/timezone.md).

Also, please check out the new [Time zone demo](https://bryntum.com/examples/calendar/timezone/).

```javascript
new Calendar({
    timeZone : 'America/Chicago'
});
```

## Time Ranges

Calendars have a new [timeRanges feature](#Calendar/feature/TimeRanges) that allows applications to render arbitrary
ranges of time as well as points in time (as lines). You can apply custom background styling and add rotated headers
with text and icons beside with the calendar's normal events.

Check out the new [Time ranges demo](https://bryntum.com/examples/calendar/timeranges/).

```javascript
new Calendar({
    features : {
        timeRanges : {}
    }
});
```

## New locales

New locales for 31 languages have been added. Currently available languages are listed in the
[localization guide](#Calendar/guides/customization/localization.md#locales).
