# What's new in Calendar v5.1.0

## Introducing Create React App templates

[Create React App script](https://create-react-app.dev/) templates are now available in the public npm repository.

If you are using **javascript only**, just type:

```shell
$ npx create-react-app my-app --template @bryntum/cra-template-javascript-calendar
```

or if you prefer using **typescript**:

```shell
$ npx create-react-app my-app --template @bryntum/cra-template-typescript-calendar
```

**Note**: Please feel free to change `my-app` to your preferred application name

Check the [React integration guide](#Calendar/guides/quick-start/react.md) for more information.

## Simplified url configuration on CrudManager

Configuring CrudManager was made a little easier by introducing shortcuts for setting load and sync urls using the new
`loadUrl` and `syncUrl` configs. When your application does not need to supply any additional configs to the transport
layer you can use them in favor of having to nest the urls. Old code like this:

```javascript
const calendar = new Calendar({
    crudManager : {
        transport : {
            load : {
                url : 'load.aspx'
            }
        }
    }
})
```

Can now be written more conveniently like this:

```javascript
const calendar = new Calendar({
    crudManager : {
        loadUrl : 'load.aspx'
    }
})
```

## New module bundle for Angular

Bryntum Calendar is now delivered with new ES Module bundle without WebComponents. This was
done to avoid conflicts with Angular which also uses WebComponents for applications.

Angular wrappers use `calendar.module.js` bundle in favor of removed `calendar.lite.umd.js` one.

Check the [upgrading guide](#Calendar/guides/upgrades/5.1.0.md#new-module-bundle-for-angular) for the details.

## New module bundle with WebComponents

Bryntum Calendar is now delivered with new `calendar.wc.module.js` ES Module bundle with WebComponents.

Check the [upgrading guide](#Calendar/guides/upgrades/5.1.0.md#new-module-bundle-with-webcomponents) for the details.

## New keyboard shortcuts functionality

[KeyMap](#Core/widget/mixin/KeyMap) is a mixin that allows for standardized and customizable keyboard shortcuts
functionality. KeyMap is mixed in to Widget by default and therefore available to all Widget child classes. There is a
new [guide](#Grid/guides/customization/keymap.md) describing how to customize currently integrated keyboard shortcuts.
