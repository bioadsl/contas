# Upgrade guide for Calendar v5.1.4

## DatePicker's `events` property deprecated

The `events` config in the Calendar sidebar's `DatePicker` has been renamed to `showEvents`. The `events` property 
is deprecated but will continue to work during its deprecation period below `6.0.0` version.

**Old code:**

```javascript
new Calendar({
    datePicker : {
        events : 'count'
    },
    ...
})
```

**New code:**

```javascript
new Calendar({
    datePicker : {
        showEvents : 'count'
    },
    ...
})
```
