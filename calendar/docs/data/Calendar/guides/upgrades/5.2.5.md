# Upgrade guide for Calendar v5.2.5

## Deprecations

The `dateRangeChange` event is deprecated. Instead, the event `dateRangeRequested` is fired
on _all_ requests to an event store for events in a date range. A new `changed` flag is included
in the event if the dates are different from the last set of events requested.

**Old code:**

```javascript
calendar.on({
    dateRangeChange() {
        // Handle date range changing
    }
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
calendar.on({
    dateRangeRequested(event) {
        if (event.changed) {
            // Handle date range changing
        }
    }
});
```
